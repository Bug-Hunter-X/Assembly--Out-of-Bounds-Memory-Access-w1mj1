This repository contains an example of an uncommon assembly language bug: accessing memory outside the bounds of an array. The bug is demonstrated in the `bug.asm` file, while the solution is presented in `bugSolution.asm`. This bug can cause segmentation faults, crashes, and unpredictable behavior.  Understanding how to prevent such issues is crucial for robust assembly programming.
